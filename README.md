# BP-PoupaMais-Python
A discount calculator for Gas, now made with Python

My first (small and humble) Python project, after just reading a few documents regarding this language. It's the same as the JS one, but in Python. I always found this programming languague to be very interesting, so I decided to learn a few things and test it out.

This app calculates the discount for gas prices for two different bikes.

# USAGE
 - Download the bp.py file to your machine
 - Open a terminal in the same directory as the bp.py file
